# Internet of Me

The [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) / [personal science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Science) movement has always been of interest to me.   Diving deep into personal informatics and data produced by sensors such as exercise trackers, heart rate monitors, blood pressure, glucose testers, comprehensive blood testing, body composition and weight sensors and relating that data to what is going on in the real world might give insight into what activities or environments are helpful and perhaps not so helpful.  Analyzing the data in the context of real life events such as outdoor events such as gardening, wood working, or head down indoors preparation of course material would be interesting.

Sensor data currently available

* 3 years of Google Fit data

  * Biking
  * Running
  * Hiking
  * Walking
  * Heart Rate for all those activities
  * GPS data for most of those activities
  * Step/Activity related data

* Blood Glucose monitor

  > Spotty data here, would need to make this a regularly scheduled event

* Smart Scale

  * Body composition and Weight

    > Not a lot of historical data, I've not weight myself since the start of the COVID pandemic

## Objectives

* Download and survey the 3 years of strored GoogleFit holdings.  What data is actually stored, in what format.  

* In order to make this a useful year long project, what other data should I capture?

* What are the security and privacy implications the capture and storage of this data?

* What trends can be identified and are they worthwhile?

* What are the downsides of actively tracking and analyzing this data?

* How accurate are the sensors used?

  > Steps without associated GPS movement data might indicate that my watch is confusing guitar for walking.  Another common issue is forgetting to take the watch off when I hop on my riding lawnmower and getting extra credit for a run when I didn't.
